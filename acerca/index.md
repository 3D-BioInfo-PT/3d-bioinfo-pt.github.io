The 3D-BioInfo-PT aims at reuniting the portuguese scientific community of this scientific area in a free of charge meeting by giving a space for discussion and sharing without commitment. This 8th edition feeds of the previous editions' sucess on Porto, Lisboa, Coimbra and Oeiras which reunited more than 60 participants in a total of more than 10 oral presentations per edition. 

## Mission and Goals
The sharing and discussion of ideas are the seeds for a strong scientific community. Due to the current pandemic situation it's ever more necessary to dynamize and stimulate a open and colaborative spirit amoung the several research groups in Portugal. Between several factors this panorama has shown the contribution and growing necessity of researchers to be able to monetize computational resources to generate quick, efficient and racional answers to real, urgent and unavoidable problems.

This contact with Portugal becomes important from the moment people get back after a Doctorate, a PhD, or any other long period spent abroad. From another side, there are also people that wish to be abroad yet still maintain and cultivate a relationship of proximity with science in Portugal. But what groups exist in the Estructural and Computational Biology field in Portugal? And do those groups research? Question arise naturally and the answers are not always so simple to find. 

This initiative wants to give an answer to some of these questions. Also wants to show the best of Computational and Structural Biology in Portugal and also give to know what do portuguese researchers study spread abroad. This way we want to give a place where projects and results can be shared and discussed in order to stimulize colaborations (both national and internationally) and amplify the Computational and Structural Biology horizons.
