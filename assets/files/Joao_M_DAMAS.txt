The reliability of physics-based in-silico studies of protein-ligand complexes highly depends on the quality of available structures and force-field parameters. 
Both these subjects have been largely addressed by both experimental and computational scientists from industry and academia. Yet, tasks like obtaining
an initial structure with the correct protonation states and hydrogen-bond network or accurate force-field parameters for a given ligand can still be out of reach 
for the non-experts in those particular fields. Here we showcase two software tools that aim at bridging this gap: proteinPrepare and parameterize. We 
show how these softwares can be easily used by the community and how we are integrating these tools within a wider computational pipeline for drug discovery.
