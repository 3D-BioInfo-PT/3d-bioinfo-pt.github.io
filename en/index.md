The Meeting of Young Researchers in Structural Computational Biology (EJIBCE) aims at bringing together the Portuguese scientific community working in the field in a free-of-charge meeting, to provide a forum for discussion and sharing with no strings attached. This third edition builds on the success of previous editions in Porto and Lisbon, which gathered ca. 60 participants and had over 30 oral communications.

## Mission & Objectives
Given the current economic situation in Europe, and particulaly in Portugal, it is increasingly harder
to obtain funding and have an optimistic approach to science and collaborations. Besides, the recent
austerity measures put in place by the Portuguese government led many researchers to join groups and
institutes abroad, and eventually lose touch with the Portuguese scientific community and developments.

After obtaining a doctoral degree or finishing a postdoctoral appointment, many Portuguese scientists
abroad look back to their country looking for an opportunity to continue their careers and contribute
to the development of Portuguese science. Others wish to remain abroad, but at the same time reach out
to the Portuguese community and cultivate stronger ties to its researchers. However, what groups are
there on Computational Structural Biology? What do they actually focus on? Are they open to collaborations?

This meeting was created in order to answer these and other similar questions. Its main goal is to
provide a simple no-frills environment where Portuguese researchers in Computational Structural Biology,
active both in Portugal and abroad, can meet and get to know each other's research and ambitions.
Ultimately, we hope that in doing so, we will be able to stimulate new collaborations and broaden the
horizons of the Portuguese community of Computational Structural Biologists.

## EJIBCE 2015
EJIBCE 2015 builds up on the format of previous editions, focusing on a small number of oral
communications interspersed with several breaks to encourage discussion and exchange of ideas.
Throughout the day, 10 researchers will present their results. Seven will be selected from the
submitted abstracts by the Scientific Committee, based on the quality and originality of the work,
and will be given 20 minutes to speak, followed by a short discussion. The remaining 3 oral
communications will be delivered by invited keynotes, who will be given 30 minutes to speak plus 10
for discussion. The program is available as a Google Calendar [here](/programa#programa).

This year's edition will take place in Coimbra, at [Instituto Pedro Nunes (IPN)](http://www.ipn.pt),
a private non-profit organisation that promotes innovation and the transfer of technology, by providing
incubator and accelerator facilities for scientific and technology startups. Differing from previous
editions, we created a session of talks on a sister area to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations
and reach a wider audience. This first cross-disciplinary session will target Systems Biology, a field
naturally complementary to Computational Structural Biology, and will boast a dedicated invited speaker
and several selected talks from the audience. Further, the choice of IPN is also not without a purpose.
Several specifically targeted companies currently housed in the incubator and accelerator will be invited
to the event, in hopes of sparking out-of-the-box discussions and collaborations.

## Guest Speakers

<img src="/images/pessoas/foto_fatima_lucas.jpg" class="mugshot" />
<strong>Fátima Lucas</strong> is senior researcher at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and the company Anaxomics Biotech, in Barcelona, Spain. Fátima received her degree in Chemistry from the University of Porto, where she also completed a MSc degree and a PhD, both in Computational Chemistry, under the guidance of Prof. Maria João Ramos. After a period of post-doctoral research at Universitat della Calabria, Italy, Fatima settled at the BSC, where she obtained a postdoctoral researcher grant from Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) and a Juan de la Cierva do MINECO postdoctoral scholarship. Her research interests are related to protein engineering with industrial applications. In particular, she is interested in the development of computational methods to guide rational design processes and/or protein directed evolution in the lab.

<strong>Bruno Correia</strong> graduated in Chemistry at the University of Coimbra (2004) and received a PhD in Computational Biology from ITQB-UNL. During his PhD work, he was supervised by David Baker and Bill Schief (2006-2011) and had the opportunity to develop computational methodologies in the field of protein design. Much of his work was focused on the design of functional protein, specifically immunogens with application in the development of new vaccines. During his post-doc at Benjamin Cravatt’s lab, the Scripps Research Institute - La Jolla (2011-2015), he developed experimental mass spectromery-based methodologies to map interactions between organic molecules and proteins in cellular proteomes. In 2015, Bruno became assistant professor in Bioengineering at the Ecole Polytecnhique Federale de Lausanne - Switzerland, where he is establishing a laboratory focused on protein engineering for therapeutic purposes using both experimental and computational strategies.

<strong>Rita Santos</strong> graduated in Biochemistry at the University of Lisbon (2007), and obtained a MSc degree in the field of drug research and development, with specialization in Computational Chemistry and Toxicology, at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (2009). During her master’s research, she investigated the role of water molecules in molecular docking simulations of human cytochrome P450 2D6 with the goal of improving the prediction of drug metabolism. This was followed by a PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of Cambridge (2014), in the group of Professor John Overington, where she investigated differences between age groups at the molecular level, which may explain different responses to drugs (e.g. child vs. adult). Since September 2014, Rita is working for GlaxoSmithKline as a computational biologist, and is involved in several projects focusing the identification and validation of therapeutic targets.
